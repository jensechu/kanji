## こんにちは！

This is a small javascript powered site that takes in `.json` data of kanji and outputs a selection box. By selecting these kanji you can make your own kanji worksheets tailored to your practicing needs.

## Features
Below are some screenshots of basic usage, along with a screenshot of the WaniKani.com API integration.

### Kanji Selection:
The Kanji are divided into different categories. As of right now I have JLPT N1-N5, and WaniKani integration. It's very simple to add more categories and kanji by just extending the `kanji.json` file.

### Stroke Orders
Two font files are loaded in so a user has the option to turn on and off stroke orders.

### Search
There is a search option which only takes a unicode kanji character. If that character is found in any of the categories on the app, it will autmatically add the kanji to the top of your worksheet.

### Formatted Sheet When Printed:
This is a shot of a formatted worksheet when you attempt to print from the website! You can select as many kanji as you want and it will always look shiny.

### Syncing w/ WaniKani.com
WaniKani.com is an amazing resource for learning the Japanese kanji system. These feature allows a user to pull down the kanji they have unlocked through the site so they are available for printing.
